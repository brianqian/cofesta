# Cofesta

Cofesta is a New York based coffee shop and wine bar located in the heart of the Flatiron.

## Specs

Built with:

- NextJS
- React
- styled-components
- Typescript
- Sendgrid
- Google Embedded Maps API

Hosted on:

- Zeit Now

## Process

This project is written in Typescript and takes full advantage of NextJS's ability to server-side render. The built in Zeit configuration allowed for a quick and easy deployment that supported serverless functions. This allows environmental variables to stay hidden and backend requests to the Sendgrid API to work. The Now platform allows for easy changes to the DNS records and provides support for continuous integration.
